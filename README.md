# GatewayFinder
GatewayFinder is a python 3 script based off of the linux environment to get the gateway address on a network, then displays the default passwords for routers with those ip's, and prompts you to open them to attempt to get in. This will not work if the network administrator changes the default password, but now in modern times isp's just add accounts ontop of the default ones, so you should still be able to get in 95% of the time. Enjoy!&lt;br>&lt;b>Usage:&lt;/b>&lt;br>Just clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/RawVendetta/GatewayFinder&lt;br>python3 gatewayfinderv1-1.py&lt;br>It's that simple! This is only one of the many primary tasks you should do while checking a networks security for holes.
